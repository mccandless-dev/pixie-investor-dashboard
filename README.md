# Pixie: Interactive Capital Strategy Dashboard

This repository contains the source code for the Pixie Interactive Capital Strategy Dashboard, a single-page web application designed to present the Pixie business plan and investment opportunity to potential investors in an engaging, interactive format.

The application transforms the traditional, static business plan into a dynamic dashboard, allowing users to explore key data, financial projections, and strategic plans through interactive charts, calculators, and diagrams.

## Live Demo
